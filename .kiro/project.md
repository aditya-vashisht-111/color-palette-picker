# Kiro Project Context – Color Palette Picker

Project:
A colorblind-safe color palette generator with light/dark chart previews and export options.

Problem:
Analysts and developers frequently need colorblind-friendly palettes for dashboards, but generating them manually is slow and inconsistent.

Solution:
A single-page web app that:
- Lets you choose 3–8 colors
- Uses a known colorblind-safe palette
- Shows light and dark chart previews
- Exports the palette in HEX, CSS variables, Matplotlib list, and Seaborn palette format

Kiro Usage:
- Generated starter HTML structure and layout
- Suggested CSS improvements for spacing and readability
- Helped design JavaScript functions for palette handling and export formats
- Assisted in drafting README and blog outline

Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Frontend-only)
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
